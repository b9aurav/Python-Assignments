1. Find gcd of a list of given numbers using gcd function in math module

2. use hypot function to find the hypotenuse of a given list of cooredinates in 2 and 3 dimensions.

3. Write a function called is_sorted that takes a list as a parameter and returns true if the list is sorted in ascendeing order and false otherwise. you can assume as a precondition that elements of the list can be compared with comparision operator.

4. Two words are anagrams if you can rearrange the letters from one to spell the other. Write a function called is_anagram that takes two strings and returns true of they are anagrams.

5. Write a function called has_duplicates that takes a list and returns True if there is any element that appears more than once. It should not modify the original list. If there are 23 students in your class what are the chances that two of you have the same Birthday? You can estimate this probability by generating random samples of 23 birthdays and checking for matches. Hint: you can generate random birthdays with the randint function in the random module.

6. Write a function called remove_duplicates that takes a list and returns a new list with only unique elements from the original.

7. Write a function that reads the file words.txt and builds a list with one element per word. Write two versions of this function,.one using the append method and the other using the idiom t= t + [x]. Which one takes longer to run?

8. Two words are a reverse pair if each is the reverse of the other. Write a program that finds all reverse pairs in the word list.
